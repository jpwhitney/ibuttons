# Filename: ibutton_download_increment_names.R
# 
# Author: Luke Miller  Jul 11, 2012
###############################################################################
# This script will allow the user to download iButtons, giving a numeric name
# to each file that increments with each new download. It will parse the raw 
# data file and extract the useful bits (to me at least): date/time, temperature
# (Celsius), user's ID for this iButton, and the serial number for this iButton, 
# and place all of these in a comma-separated-value file that can be easily 
# opened in Excel or R. Each downloaded iButton data file has the current date 
# and time included in the filename to avoid overwriting older data files. Raw 
# data files are stored in a directory with today's date on it, while the parsed 
# csv files go in a 2nd directory.

# The thermodl.exe file was originally downloaded as part of the Maxim iButton 
# 1-Wire Public Domain Kit. 
# There are several versions of the Kit available, including
# versions with pre-compiled binaries (executables) for Windows/Linux/OSX.
# http://www.maxim-ic.com/products/ibutton/software/1wire/wirekit.cfm
# On my Windows 7 x64 computer using the DS9490B USB ibutton adapter, I used the
# precompiled binary build for Win64 USB (DS9490 + WinUSB) Preliminary Version 
# 3.11 Beta 2,
# filename: winusb64vc311Beta2_r2.zip, downloaded 2012-03-15
# Unzip this file and find the .exe files thermoms.exe and thermodl.exe in the
# builds\winusb64vc\release folder. Copy these to your R working directory.
# The drivers for the DS9490 USB iButton adapter must also be downloaded and 
# installed: 
# http://www.maxim-ic.com/products/ibutton/software/tmex/
# I downloaded and installed the file "install_1_wire_drivers_x64_v403.msi"
# The Java OneWireViewer app can also be downloaded and used to verify that your
# drivers work and that you can communicate with iButtons successfully through 
# the USB adapter. You can download this app here: 
# http://www.maxim-ic.com/products/ibutton/software/1wire/OneWireViewer.cfm
