# Filename: mission_launch_multi_save_serials.R
# A script to upload new missions to iButton Thermochron temperature 
# dataloggers. See the comments below for the additional external software 
# needed to make this run. This version will loop continuously and upload the 
# same mission to multiple iButtons so that they all start at the same 
# absolute time and sample at the same frequency. This version saves the serial
# number of each launched iButton in order in a csv file.

mem.length = 2048 # Number of data points the ibutton can hold. This is just

# The thermoms.exe file was originally downloaded as part of the Maxim iButton 
# 1-Wire Public Domain Kit. 
# There are several versions of the Kit available, including
# versions with pre-compiled binaries (executables) for Windows/Linux/OSX.
# http://www.maxim-ic.com/products/ibutton/software/1wire/wirekit.cfm
# On my Windows 7 x64 computer using the DS9490B USB ibutton adapter, I used the
# precompiled binary build for Win64 USB (DS9490 + WinUSB) Preliminary Version 
# 3.11 Beta 2,
# filename: winusb64vc311Beta2_r2.zip, downloaded 2012-03-15
# Unzip this file and find the .exe files thermoms.exe (and thermodl.exe) in the
# builds\winusb64vc\release folder. Copy these to your R working directory.
# The drivers for the DS9490 USB iButton adapter must also be downloaded and 
# installed: 
# http://www.maxim-ic.com/products/ibutton/software/tmex/
# I downloaded and installed the file "install_1_wire_drivers_x64_v403.msi"
# The Java OneWireViewer app can also be downloaded and used to verify that your
# drivers work and that you can communicate with iButtons successfully through 
# the USB adapter. You can download this app here:
